# Model Checkpoints Directory

This directory is used to store model checkpoints during training. Checkpoints allow for resuming training from a saved state and selecting the best model based on validation metrics.

Checkpoint files typically include:
- Model state dict
- Optimizer state
- Training configuration
- Current epoch/iteration
- Performance metrics

Note: Checkpoint files are gitignored, but this README will be kept to maintain the directory structure.
