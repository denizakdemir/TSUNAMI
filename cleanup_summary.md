# TSUNAMI Project Cleanup Summary

## Directory Structure Reorganization
- Removed empty directories: `enhanced_deephit/losses` and `enhanced_deephit/modules`
- Moved feature importance code from `utils/importance.py` to `visualization/importance/importance.py`
- Organized visualization modules with proper `__init__.py` files

## Code Consolidation
- Consolidated data generation functions in `simulation/data_generation.py`:
  - Renamed `_add_missing_values` to `add_missing_values` and improved its functionality
  - Added proper parameter typing and docstrings
  - Made functions more consistent in their interfaces
  
## Duplicate Code Removal
- Removed duplicated data generation code from example files
- Used the centralized functions from `simulation/data_generation.py` in all examples:
  - `single_risk_example.py`
  - `competing_risks_example.py`
  - `multi_task_example.py`

## Imports Harmonization
- Updated imports in all files to reflect the new module structure
- Created proper `__init__.py` files with exports to simplify imports

## Documentation Improvements
- Added improved docstrings to simulation functions
- Updated README.md with the new project structure and features
- Clarified function parameters and return values

## API Consistency
- Made function naming more consistent
- Standardized parameter names across similar functions
- Made code style more uniform throughout the codebase

## Other Improvements
- Ensured all modules can be properly imported
- Added a comprehensive project structure section to README.md
- Modularized functions for better reusability
- Removed the redundant `venv` directory inside the package

The cleaned-up project now has a more logical structure, reduced code duplication, and improved API consistency, making it easier to maintain and extend.
